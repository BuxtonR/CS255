**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system
did they want you to design?**

The client, Liam, is the owner of DriverPass. DriverPass is a company that wants to
improve training for future drivers. Liam wanted a system that would allow users to take
online classes, practice tests, and make reservations for in-person driving lessons. The
system also needed to accommodate different roles within the company, and it needed
to be useable by various devices and platforms.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I gathered requirements from the client, thoroughly understood their needs, and made
sure all aspects of the system were addressed in my documentation.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would
you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could revice these documents, I would focus on the functional and non-functional
requirements. As the project continues and evolves, the requirements will also need
updated and changed. I would like to eventually come to a point where very little
changes are needed, which will be achieved as input from the client is received.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The user&#39;s needs were identified through requirement gathering sessions with the client.
The needs were then converted into specific system functionalities and features.
Considering user needs is crucial when designing because the system&#39;s success hinges
on how well it meets these needs. A system that is not user-friendly or fails to provide
the desired service for the client, will not be successful.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you
use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

When designing software, consulting with the client to understand their needs and
preferences would be the first step. Next, I would create a plan to implement these
needs and designing the software. In the future to analyze and design a system, I would
evaluate feedback, and consider the systems constraints. From there I would update
the system with any required changes.# CS255 Module Eight Journal
